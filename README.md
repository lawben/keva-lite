# :key: keva-lite | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lawben/keva-lite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lawben/keva-lite)
### A single file key-value store. Like SQLite, just without the SQL. 

One big advantage of SQLite is that it is contained within one portable file. **keva-lite** aims to do the same for a general key-value store.

This is still in development. Currently, only insert and retrieval of keys are possible. Removing and updating keys still needs to be implemented.

More README soon...
